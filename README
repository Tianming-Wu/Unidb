# Uni DB

English | [中文](README.zh_CN)

This project implements a simple, light-weighted database system, which is completely portable.

## Features
- Portable: No files are storaged in the local file system.

- Encryption Support (Not present).



## Warnings
- These important features are not supported:
  - Atomic operation
  - Read/Write Protection
  - Multiple access point
  - Real-time sync

So if you want to use it on a portable device, you need to ensure that any application using the database should be closed or saved to disk in advance.
